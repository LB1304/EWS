In this repository we illustrate the $R$ code used to implement Early Warning Systems based on hidden Markov and binary regression models. 



In particular, this repository contains: 
1. the file [`EWS_Functions.R`](EWS_Functions.R), which includes all the functions required to estimate the models and perform prediction. Each function is documented inside the file;
2. the file `EWS_Data.RData`, which contains a simulated dataset used for illustrative purposes;
3. the folder `Example`, which provides example scripts with code and output to replicate the main results.
